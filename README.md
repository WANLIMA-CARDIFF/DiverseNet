# DiverseNet: Decision Diversified Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation Networks for Remote Sensing Imagery

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2311.13716-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13716)

This repository contains the official implementation of **DiverseHead**, a lightweight and effective semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework for remote sensing imagery. DiverseHead introduces: Dynamic Freezing and Dropout for perturbation.

The proposed methods achieve competitive performance across four public remote sensing datasets and outperform several state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised segmentation.
